# Outline



* Introduction

  * Problem definition
    * Ad hoc microphone arrays and their applications
  * What am I trying to do
  * Motivation
    * Microphones unknown location
    * ?clustering as a possible solution
  * Summary of results

* Background

  * Literature

  * Features?

  * Signal model

  * Speaker separation

    * ! ook formules

  * Clustering source dominated microphones

    * Fuzzy clustering

    * Federated learning

    * Coherence-based clustering

  * Proposed methods

    * Compare to coherence based in time domain

* Implementation

  * Implementation coherence based clustering
  * Another implementation
  * Nilesh said one would probably not be enough
    * Coherence in time domain
    * Iedere tijdssample updaten
  * Evaluation metrics
  * Speaker separation
    * metrics using generated clusters
  * Results

* Conclusion
